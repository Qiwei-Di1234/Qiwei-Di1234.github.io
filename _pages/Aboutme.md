I’m a fan of pure mathematics with a deep interest in nearly all of its aspects. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring purely theoretical math topics, like differentiable manifolds, Riemannian geometry, Lie group, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and so on. Although I never imagine I’d be able to be an expert in any of these areas, my passion for them keeps me motivated. As the famous quote by von Neumann goes, "Young man, in mathematics you don’t understand things. You just get used to them." I don’t aim to fully understand or apply mathematics; rather, I’m continually captivated by its intrinsic beauty.

For the same reason, I have an enduring belief in the power of mathematics. As a Phd student in artifical intelligence, I am convinced that every promising AI method must be grounded by a beautiful and compelling mathematical foundation. The elegance and rigor of mathematics will not only clarify AI's mechanisms but also drive breakthroughs that push the field forward. The current gap between theory and practice doesn’t diminish the need for mathematics; instead, it inspires me to explore the endless possibilities for developing new mathematical theories.

Last but not least, I wish that I could remain to be a passionate and kind person, dedicated to exploring interesting and meaningful problems in this rapidly evolving era of artificial intelligence.
